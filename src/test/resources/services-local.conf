# This file is read when runLocal = true in application.conf (default)

# This can be used to override the 'baseUrl'

# If the service name you are searching is found, baseUrl is overridden.
# For local development convenience, host and protocol will have the following defaults:
#      protocol = http
#      host = localhost

# Example 1: (the base url for helloworld-service is https://127.0.0.1:9000)
# helloworld-service {
#      protocol = https
#      host = 127.0.0.1
#      port = 9000
# }

# Example 2: (the base url for helloworld-service is http://localhost:9000)
# helloworld-service.port = 9000
